# Startup_India
This is a code to scrape data from Startup portal of Government of India. It helps in getting the names of different startups in different states, industries etc. and store them. THe information stored contains name of startup, industry, sector, stage, state and their URL. The URL of each starup can be further used to extract information on each starup. 
The file "WebScraping_Codes_for_DataCollection" is used for data extraction and needs to be run on JUPYTER NOTEBOOK only.
The "WEBDRIVER" path needs to be specified as on the local machine, because it varies for each individual.
